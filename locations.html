					<h2><em>Details</em></h2>
				<p>The Coromandel Peninsula lies east of Auckland, on the other side of the Hauraki Gulf.<br />

					Rustic, relaxed and unspoiled, the Coromandel is one of New Zealand's best-loved holiday destinations.
					<br />
					The rugged volcanic hills are cloaked in native rainforest, and more than 400 kilometres of spectacular coastline promises you can find the beach of your dreams. The Coromandel is a place where bush and beach are both easily accessible. In the same day, you can experience the blue dazzle of the Pacific Ocean and calming greenness of the kauri forest.
					<br/>
					On the west coast, there's a never-ending parade of beaches, coves and harbours lined with pohutukawa trees (a red flowering native of New Zealand).
					<br/>
					The eastern side of the Coromandel is furnished with an amazing collection of white sand and surf beaches, and an impressive, heavily forested mountain range runs right up the middle of the peninsula.</p>
