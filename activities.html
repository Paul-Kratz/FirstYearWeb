					<p>Welcome to the rush of skydiving. There is nothing like skydiving for sheer heart-stopping adrenalin and adventure and there is no place like New Zealand to do it.</p>
					</br>
					<p>New Zealand's magnificent landscapes take on an extra dimension when you’re 12,000 feet in the air. Skydive in <a href="http://www.skydivewanaka.com/">Lake Wanaka</a> , <a href="http://www.nzoneskydive.co.nz/tandem-skydive/skydive-prices">Queenstown</a> or <a href="http://www.skydivetaupo.co.nz/">Taupo</a> and you will look from the vastness of the Central Otago high country to the snow-capped mountains surrounding the jewel-like lakes. At the other end of the country, Lake Taupo has the largest commercial drop zone in the world and stunning views of volcanoes, forests and the lake itself. A Bay of Plenty skydive flight will take you over gleaming waters and geothermal wonders. </p>
					</br>
					<p>There are many skydiving operations throughout New Zealand and all offer tandem jumps. You’ll have experienced skydivers taking you-step-by-step through what to do on your jump and what to expect. If you’re a skydiver yourself don’t forget to bring your licence.</p>
